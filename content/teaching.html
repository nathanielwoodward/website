For now, here are <strong>twenty-five heuristics for promoting learning.</strong></p>

<th><strong>Heuristic</strong></th>
<th><strong>Description</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Contiguity effects</td>
<td>Ideas to be associated should be presented contiguously in space and time</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Perceptual-motor grounding</td>
<td>Concepts benefit from being grounded in perceptual motor experiences, particularly at early stages of learning</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Dual code and multimedia effects</td>
<td>Materials presented in verbal, visual, and multimedia form richer representations than a single medium</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Testing effect</td>
<td>Testing enhances learning, particularly when the tests are alligned with important content</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Spacing effect</td>
<td>Spaced schedules of studying and testing produce better long-term retention than a single study session or test</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Exam expectations</td>
<td>Students benefit more form repeated testing when they expect a final exam</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Generation effects</td>
<td>Learning is enhanced when learners produce answers compared to having them recognize answers</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Organization effects</td>
<td>Outlining, integrating, and synthesizing information produces better learning than rereading materials or other more passive strategies</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Coherence effect</td>
<td>Materials and multimedia should explicitly link related ideas and minimize distsracting irrelevant material</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Stories and example cases</td>
<td>Stories and example cases tend to be remembered better than didactic facts and abstract principles</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Multiple examples</td>
<td>An understanding of an abstract concept improves with multiple and varied examples</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Feedback effects</td>
<td>Students benefit from feedback on their performance in a learning task, but the timing of the feedback can depend on the task</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Negative suggestion effects</td>
<td>Learning wrong information can be reduced when feedback is immediate</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Desirable difficulties</td>
<td>Challenges make learning and retrieval effortful and thereby have posotive effects on long-term retention</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Manageable cognitive load</td>
<td>The information presented to the learner should not overload working memory</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Segmentation principle</td>
<td>A complex lesson should be broken down into manageable subparts</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Explanation effects</td>
<td>Students benefit more from constructing deep coherent explanations (mental models) of the material than memorizing shallow isolated facts</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Deep questions</td>
<td>Students benefit more from asking and answering deep questions that elicit explanations (e.g., why, how, what if) than shallow questions (e.g., who, what, when, where)</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Cognitive disequilibrium</td>
<td>Deep reasoning and learning is stimulated by problems that create cognitive disequilibrium, such as obstacles to goals, contradictions, conflict, and anomalies</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Cognitive flexibility</td>
<td>Cognitive flexibility improves with multiple viewpoints that link facts, skills, procedures, and deep conceptual principles</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Goldilocks principle</td>
<td>Assignments should not be too hard or too easy, but at the right level of difficulty for the student’s level of skill or prior knowledge</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Imperfect metacognition</td>
<td>Students rarely have an accurate knowledge of their cognition, so their ability to calibrate their comprehension, learning, and memory should not be trusted</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Discovery learning</td>
<td>Most students have trouble discovering important principles on their own, without careful guidance, scaffolding, or materials with well-crafted affordances</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Self-regulated learning</td>
<td>Most students need training in how to self-regulate their learning and other cognitive processes</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Anchored learning</td>
<td>Learning is deeper and students are more motivated when the materials and skills are anchored in real-world problems that matter to the learner</td>
</tr>
