These next few posts will chart our impending journey to New Zealand, which begins on a CapMetro bus this morning at 9:30am and ends with our arrival to Auckland Int. Airport at 12:50pm on December 31 (for us, there is no December 30th...) Along the way, we have two excellent layovers (Los Angeles & Nadi, Fiji) so expect to hear more about these places as well.  
  
Below is a thingum I made that roughly maps out (and even animates!) our itinerary. Though illustrative, it may not be completely accurate, so don't rely upon it for good information.
