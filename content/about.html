<h1>Hello and welcome!</h1>
<p>My name is Nathaniel Woodward (<em>né</em> Raley) and I am a data science professional and former faculty member in <a href="https://stat.utexas.edu/">Statistics and Data Sciences</a> at UT Austin, where I earned both PhD (2018) and MS (2016) while working as a researcher and statistical consultant.</p>
<p>I am interested in modern statistical approaches to causal inference, especially as they apply to evaluations of human behavioral phenomena. In my research, I have drawn upon variety of data sources to investigate teaching effectiveness, curriculum redesign, pathways through college, and other questions important to university stakeholders.</p>
<p>I have experience modeling the causal effect of large-scale interventions, including a nationwide randomized effectiveness trial. I have also conducted laboratory studies with human subjects to test interventions designed to improve long-term retention and transfer of learning to new contexts.</p>
<p>I am also interested in human–computer interaction and have experience applying psychometric techniques to adaptively model latent traits (such as ability and mastery) based on people’s interactions with technology (e.g., click-stream and other log data, biometric measurements) and using such models to inform predictions and to optimize training regimens.</p>
<p>For some examples of my past work, see the <a href="/portfolio/">portfolio</a> page.</p>

<h3>More about me</h3>
<!--In both my teaching and my research, my guiding purpose is to improve lifetime learning outcomes---to create meaningful learning experiences that lead to durable, flexible knowledge; to show how enjoyable learning can be to motivate the pursuit of knowledge for its own sake; to help assemble the cognitive and metacognitive skillset needed for a life of independent inquiry.-->
<p>I love learning<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> and I <em>really</em> love learning about learning<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>—the love of learning infuses my every moment with excitement and personal meaning. When you love learning, life is transformed from a thing that <em>happens to you</em> into a first-person <em>quest</em> for truth, beauty, and goodness: new experiences are mingled with old ones in the crucible of your imagination, producing ever-better mental models of reality, connecting previously unrelated ideas to form new patterns, new visions about the way things are… Once set aflame, this passion for personal truth is continually stoked by the small thrill of every realization and sustained by our profound need to bring order to ourselves and to the cosmos—the conviction that the universe will prove to make some final sense. A joy of learning suffuses life with meaning! It is the essence of education and the prerogative of every human being! We should all feel the tug of curiosity, the engulfing flow of discovery and problem-solving, the sheer awe of finally “getting it.” Every little epiphany is worth its weight in gold: the final product of your every lesson-learned is far more what you know, it is who you are!</p>
<p>But if you are reading this, a lot of “life” has already happened to you: many formative experiences are now well in our past, and from them, relatively stable identities have emerged. Along the way, our schools and workplaces have communicated the view that life is a series of repetitive, unenjoyable duties done grudgingly in exchange for material rewards or social status. But life is not about following directions, or even giving them; no, it is about making new directions, your own directions! To do this requires freeing one’s soul from the sedative cocoon of daily routines and instant gratification long enough to realize that there is still real mystery out in the world, still an infinitude of unrealized possibilities for your future self, still countless unanswered questions and fundamental problems that have become hidden underneath all the artificial cruft of modern life. The first task of an educator is to inspire students, to bring these timeless human issues and ultimate scientific questions into the light of day and to make a case for alternative lifestyles that are guided by them (I leave these as a short exercise for the reader<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>). If these questions do not pull all students into their orbit, then at least they have given prominence to human incompleteness and conflictedness: discontent and the awareness of alternatives form the starting-point of much meaningful intellectual activity! In the words of Allan Bloom,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The passions should be bound up in the glorious project of fulfilling human nature and searching for final truths, and this binding should be the goal of education.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Students who love to learn will seek meaning, truth, and enjoyment in everything they do—and they will find it.</p>

<p>Why <a href="/post/">blog</a>? Initially it was just to have a place to externalize ideas so I wouldn’t forget them—a digital creel to take fishing in the stream of consciousness. Life’s too short for fleeting thoughts; here I could pin them all down side by side and, under the loupe of scrutiny, come to determine (and revise!) what it is I believe.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Good old Plato would’ve called sites like these <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypomnema">hypomnemata</a>; they work like a prosthetic memory for one’s musings (amusing, bemusing), serving as a record of the person I was for the people I will become. I can now look back and see how, in each post or upload, I have unconsciously embedded aspects of my identity-at-the-time. When we write, the billions of experiences we’ve had since birth are brought to bear, and so the author leaves a residue even as he is changed by the process itself.</p>

<p>You too can see what I say: the internet has created a sort of reverse-voyeurism where I get to say <a href="/post/">Important Things</a> behind a one-way (or is it two-way?) mirror and pretend you’re watching… even an imagined audience can cause <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactivity_(psychology)">reactivity</a> and I’m a people-pleaser besides! <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost">Sunk costs</a> being what they are (e.g., domain registration fee, hours of my life getting this thing up and running), I hope to channel <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_aversion">loss-aversion</a> into regular updates and upkeep so drop by and hold me to account<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> (or I can just imagine that you’ve been by)!</p>
<p>In August 2017, I migrated my blog and personal website from blogger/AWS to GitHub/Netlify so I could blog stats stuff more simply straight from R Studio using the <a href="https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown"><strong>blogdown</strong></a> package developed by Yihui Xie. I was originally using his theme as well, but the current theme is adapted from <a href="https://github.com/htr3n/hyde-hyde">htr3n’s</a> adaptation of <a href="https://github.com/spf13/hyde">spf13’s</a> theme. I have tweaked it considerably (and wasted much time in doing so), including the addition of bigfootjs for fun footnotes.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<p>Despite the impression you may have gotten from my overwrought prose style,<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> I am extremely economical and I abominate waste, especially that of time (the thing I value most highly) or money (which I must sell my time to get).<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

<p>I am also quite risk-averse, so I seldom go out anywhere unless compelled by strong arguments: the chances of my meeting an untimely end (or of having my time/money wasted!) go up dramatically when I leave the hearthstones cooling behind me and venture out among my fellow man,<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> so I try my best to avoid it.</p>

<p>If I were a nonhuman animal, I have it on good authority that I would be an umbrella cockatoo.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a>
In my relationships with people, I am a strong proponent of the Nordic theory of love<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> and I am highly susceptible to second-hand embarassment (Germans say <em>fremdschämen</em>). I get positively irate about the residue left behind after peeling stickers off of jars.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Yes, I like a jarring juxtaposition, but give me the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unity_of_opposites">unity of opposites</a> any day. I love words themselves<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> and I like to play word games; I have been known to <a href="https://genius.com/anhinga">coopt rapgenius for literary annotations/glosses I can’t find elsewhere</a>.</p>
<p>I prefer my words in text form, and with few exceptions I don’t really like movies or TV.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44370058-nathaniel">Vis-à-vis fiction</a>, the Recognitions is gospel and Suttree my book of sacred psalms. And though their respective Apostles have been perennially passed over for the prize (add Nabokov to their number), I think <a href="http://www.ohnorobot.com/random.pl?comic=636">Chris Onstad</a> deserves the next Literature Nobel solely for his achievements in the genre of webcomics. My sense of humor is literally just Achewood and P.G. Wodehouse and that’s all.</p>
<p>For some reason I have been listening to a lot of modern <a href="/music">music</a> lately, and though indie rock and art pop predominate my streams, my tastes are pretty genre-catholic. That being said, I generally prefer music (catchy, orchestral, ethereal, outre, virtuosic) over lyrics.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Lyrics that are overly literal are often insipid and cringey to me and there is no surer way to spoil an otherwise-great song (looking at you, T Swift). As Joanna Newsom said in an interview when asked about her songs’ literal meanings, <em>“If I could say it all the way [in words], I wouldn’t have bothered making a record.”</em><a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<!--Most of what people have to communicate is boring and embarassing (the more so the more earnestly they believe that it isn't), and it follows that most lyrics are trash.-->
<p>Often, I’ll really like a song until I understand the lyrics.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> If I <em>have</em> to understand the words themselves, I like for them to be impressionistic, non-narrative, evocative, and imagery-rich (think Neutral Milk Hotel)<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a>, or grand-sounding fantasy gibberish (King Crimson, Yes<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a>), or free-associationy melodic word-salad with pop-culture references (think Das Racist, Panda Bear), or so vapid as to be entirely ignorable vectors for sound (most modern radio pop), or delivered in a unique and sufficiently distracting voice (like Coheed, Grimes, Bon Iver), or meaningful-sounding yet impossible-to-pin-down polysemy whose ambiguity lends itself to endless hermenuetics, particularly stuff of the sad-dad variety (think The National).</p>

My unique kind of animal can also live a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetarian_cuisine#Cuisine_that_is_traditionally_vegetarian">happy</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetarianism#Health_effects">healthy</a> life <em>at very little personal expense</em> without causing other animals to feel pain or to die.”

I don’t believe other animals, even other mammals, have anything like human consciousness. Nor do I believe they should be accorded human rights.
