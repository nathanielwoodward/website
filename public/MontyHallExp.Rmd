## The Monty Hall Problem is Very Counterintuitive

- If you still don't believe it, you are in good company:

## Simplest Explanation

- Your first choice has a 1/3 chance of having the car
- So there's a 2/3 it is behind one of the other doors

- Monty will never open the door with the car behind it 
- After he opens a door, the entire 2/3 probability shifts to the other closed door

## Monty is Key!

- Imagine you chose door 1, and you are asked whether you want the prize behind door 1 or *the better of* the prizes behind doors 2 and 3

- This is exactly what you get when you switch (because Monty always removes the worse prize of the two when he opens a door)!

## Another Appeal to Intuition

- Imagine there are 100 doors, 99 goats, and 1 car
- You pick a door, so you have a 1/100 chance of winning the car
- Then Monty opens 98 of the doors revealing 98 of the goats
- There is still one other unopened door: Should you switch? 

- If you pick a goat on your first choice (99/100), you will always get the car if you switch
- By switching, you only get a goat if you had the car at first, and that's super rare (1/100)

## More Involved (and More Satisfying) Explanation

### Consider the Following Scenario:

- Say **you pick door 1** and then **Monty opens door 3**
- Should you stay with door 1 or switch to door 2? 

- Before Monty opened door 3, the car had a $1/3$ chance of being behind each door

$$
p(car1)=\frac 13,\ \ \ p(car2)= \frac 13, \ \ \ p(car3)=\frac 13
$$

- But Monty is not opening doors at random: He will *always* open a goat door (and never the car)!

- What is the probability Monty opens door 3, the true location of the car?

- If you were right initially (the car is actually behind door 1), Monty can open either door 2 or door 3 (and picks one at random):

$$
p(open3 \mid car 1) = \frac 12 \\
\text{(in words: the probability Monty opens #3 given that the car is behind #1 is 1/2)}
$$

- However, if you chose door 1 and the car is behind door 2, Monty has no choice but to open door 3! 

$$
p(open3 \mid car2) = 1
$$

- Finally, if you chose door 1 and the car is behind door 3, Monty cannot open door three without revealing the car! This has no chance of happening.

$$
p(open3 \mid car3) = 0
$$


## Bayes' Rule

- OK, so you chose door 1 and then monty opened door 3
- What are the chances that the car is behind door 2 (i.e., should you switch)?

- We are interested in $p(car2 \mid open3)$
- From above, we already have the flip of it, but this is not the same: $p(open3 \mid car2)$

- We can turn it around using Bayes' rule, which states that

$$
p(A\mid B)=\frac{p(A)p(B\mid A)}{p(B)}
$$

In our case, 

$$
p(car2 \mid open3)=\frac{p(car2)p(open3 \mid car2)}{p(open3)}
$$

- We already have the two pieces in the numerator (from above):

$$
p(car2 \mid open3)=\frac{(\frac 13 )\left(1\right)}{p(open3)}
$$


- We just need the denominator (the probability Monty opens door 3)
- We can get this by adding together the probabilities of all the different situations in which Monty opens door 3 (this is the Law of Total Probability):

$$
\begin{aligned}
p(open3)&=p(open3\ \& \ car1)+p(open3\ \& \ car2)+p(open3\ \& \ car3)\\
&=p(car1)p(open3 \mid car1)+p(car2)p(open3 \mid car2)+p(car3)p(open3 \mid car3)\\
&=(\frac13)(\frac 12)+(\frac13)(1)+(\frac13)(0)\\
&=(\frac16)+(\frac13)+(0)\\
&=\frac 12
\end{aligned}
$$

- Now we have the denominator, so

$$
p(car2 \mid open3)=\frac{(\frac 13 )\left(1\right)}{(\frac12)}=2/3
$$

- This tells us that, if we picked door 1 and Monty opened door 3, then there is a $\frac23$ chance that the car is behind door 2

- That means there is only a $\frac13$ chance the car is behind door 1 (let's use Bayes' rule again)

$$
p(car1 \mid open3)=\frac{(\frac 13 )(\frac 12)}{(\frac12)}=1/3
$$

- Thus, we would be much better off switching!

- This will be true no matter which door you pick initially!



```{R}
car1<-1/3
car2<-1/3
car3<-1/3

# Say you choose door 1

# Monty will never open the door with the car behind it (!)
# What is the probability Monty opens door 3, given your choice and the actual location of the car?

open3_car1<-1/2
open3_car2<-1
open3_car3<-0

## Monty is CERTAIN to open door 3 if the car is behind door 2
## Monty is only 50:50 to open door 3 if the car is behind door 1
## Therefore, Monty opening door 3

## What is the probability that the car is behind door 1, given door 3 was opened?

car1_open3=car1*open3_car1/(car1*open3_car1+car2*open3_car2+car3*open3_car3)

## What is the probability that the car is behind door 2, given door 3 was opened?

car2_open3=car2*open3_car2/(car1*open3_car1+car2*open3_car2+car3*open3_car3)
```
