In Fall 2018 I discovered that I enjoy a certain kind of bar-style karaoke: [Karaoke Underground](http://karaokeunderground.com) specializes in tracks from somewhat obscure indie and punk artists, though there are a fair number of more popular jams. See here for the slowly growing [song list](http://karaokeunderground.com/?page_id=16). Below, I list the songs I have sung by date in chronological order.

## The Songs I've Sung (Last Updated 1/22/2019)
