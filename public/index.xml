      <description>Let’s enrich our previous discussion of linear regression by considering outcome data that is binary/dichotomous (e.g., success/failure, whether someone recovered or not) and data that is count-based (e.g., number of distinct species per survey site).
In a regular linear regression, we model an outcome \(Y\) as a linear function of explanatory variables \(X_i\) and error \(e\), like this
\[ Y=\beta_0+\beta_1X_1+\dots+\beta_nX_n+e, \phantom{xxxxx} e\sim N(0,\sigma) \] Let’s focus on the case of just a single predictor,</description>

      <description>One Within-Subjects Factor Partitioning the Total Sum of Squares (SST)  Naive analysis (not accounting for repeated measures) Mixed-effects model of same data Checking Assumptions Effect size  One between, one within (a two-way split plot design) Two within-subjects factors Real Example   Hello again! In previous posts I have talked about one-way ANOVA, two-way ANOVA, and even MANOVA (for multiple response variables). But in practice, there is yet another way of partitioning the total variance in the outcome that allows you to account for repeated measures on the same subjects.</description>

      <description>MANOVA MANOVA stands for Multivariate (or Multiple) Analysis of Variance, and it’s just what it sounds like. You have multiple response variables, and you want to test whether any of them differ across levels of your explanatory variable(s) (i.e., your groups). The null hypothesis here is that the means of each response variable are equal at every level of the explanatory variable(s); the alternative is that at least one response variable differs.</description>

      <description>A couple months ago a colleague and I volunteered for some outreach at a local science museum. It was for an 21+ night (i.e., lots of nerdy adults drinking beers together) and the theme was “Get Your Game On”. As we are both faculty in the Department of Statistics and Data Sciences, we were spoiled for choice, but finally decided to set up a Monty Hall station where people would come by and play a version of the notoriously confusing Let’s Make a Deal game (the original car/goat scenario).</description>

      <description>Why do we use sample means? The sample mean, \(\bar x = \frac 1 N\sum x_i\), is a workhorse of modern statistics. For example, t tests compare two sample means to judge if groups are likely different at the population level, and ANOVAs compare sample means of more groups to achieve something similar. But does \(\bar x\) actually deserve the great stature is has inherited?

      <description>Enemy Tank Problem: Estimating Population Size  In wartime, it is advantageous to know how well-equipped your adversary is. Ideally, you would like to have full knowledge of their armory: exactly how many tanks, planes, and ships they have that are currently battle-ready.
Unfortunately, there is no good way to get this information. Imagine, however, that you have managed to capture \(k\) tanks from the enemy. Furthermore, each enemy tank has a serial number stamped on it.</description>

      <description>A literature review and theoretical framework for understanding how people learn from feedback. Three main findings are situated within their respective theoretical accounts and then integrated: feedback messages should convey information about correctness, highlight the correct answer, and provide additional context for why the answer is correct; errors made with higher confidence are more likely to be corrected (the &amp;ldquo;hypercorrection effect&amp;rdquo;&amp;quot;), and the finding that delayed feedback produces better long-term learning than immediate feedback.</description>

      <description>A large-scale characterization of normative educational practices (e.g., course structure, teaching methods, learning activities) across more than 1,000 high-enrollment undergraduate courses at a large public institution over the last 5 years. I assess the extent to which course features reflect educational best-practices by systematically reviewing course syllabi—documenting the type, quantity, and grade- weight of all work assigned in each course as well as the prevalence and variability of teaching practices such as group activities, retrieval practice, and in-class active learning.</description>

      <description>This research builds directly upon my descriptive analysis (see below) by combining the syllabus dataset with student records to assess how prerequisite-course features affect student performance in their subsequent courses. Specifically, introductory courses high and low in retrieval-practice requirements were compared in terms of their students subsequent success using inverse propensity-score weighted logistic regressions with cluster-robust standard errors to improve causal inference. Results showed that additional retrieval practice improved students’ performance in their subsequent courses.</description>

      <description>Introducing variability during learning can facilitate transfer to new contexts (i.e., generalization). We explore the concept of variability in an area of research where its effects have received little attention: learning through retrieval practice. In four experiments, we investigate whether retrieval practice with different examples of a concept promotes greater transfer than repeated retrieval practice with the same example. All four experiments showed that variability during retrieval practice produced superior transfer of knowledge to new examples.</description>

      <description>Part 2: the t-Distribution We saw in the previous post that if X is a random variable and the population distribution of X is normal with mean \(\mu\) and standard deviation \(\sigma\) (variance \(\sigma^2\)), then the distribution of the sample mean \(\bar{X}\) for samples of a given size \(n\) is normal, with mean \(\mu\) and standard deviation of \(\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\), which we can write \(\bar{X}_n \sim N(\mu,\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}})\).1 More exciting, we saw that by the Central Limit Theorem, the sampling distribution will be normal regardless of the original population distribution if the sample size is large enough.</description>

      <description>Hello! This is the first in a series of posts that cover topics typically encountered on any Introduction to Statistics course syllabus (yes, that is to say frequentist). The idea was born out of a desire to blog about the Analysis of Variance and its many forms, but I soon found myself addressing pre-requisites, which led to tangents and lemmas that took on lives of (and ballooned into posts of) their own.</description>

      <description>In less than two day&#39;s time, I was able to purchase my third computer from a perfect-craigslist-stranger (without issue!) and replace the hard disk with a solid state drive, and I wanted to take a minute to document the experience here; if you are interested only in a rough guide for SSD installation for a 2017 HP laptop, you are heartily encouraged to skip down several paragraphs.
The computer in question is an HP 15-ba113cl that the original owner bought in February 2017 from our local Costco for around $400.</description>

      <description>A large undergraduate course at the University of Texas implemented a new class structure that replaces high-stakes tests with daily quizzes administered during class via computer. I propose an innovation to optimize content delivery to improve learning outcomes. Given graded student quiz data from one semester of this course, I use multidimensional item response theory (MIRT) and sparse factor analysis (SPARFA) to jointly estimate concepts underlying the items and each students’ mastery of these concepts, demonstrating the efficacy of this approach in real-world example.</description>

      <description>Every couple of days I force myself to go outside and run about 2-4 miles. I do not enjoy it. It makes me feel like I am dying every time; I gasp and wheeze and, even after showering I stay uncomfortably sweaty for a few hours. Worse still, I do not feel &amp;ldquo;energized&amp;rdquo; or whatever other vital sensations people claim to derive from exercise; if anything, I feel especially fatigued afterwards, and this only gets more pronounced as the day progresses.</description>

      <description>I found out about John R. Anderson almost immediately upon discovering intelligent tutoring systems a few years ago; he and his research group at Carnegie Mellon have blazed the way forward with these technologies. Their Cognitive Tutor, for example, is currently #5 out of 39 interventions in mathematics education, as evaluated by the US Department of Education&#39;s &amp;ldquo;What Works Clearing House&amp;quot;. I learned that, notwithstanding these educational pursuits, his life&#39;s work had been more about developing a &amp;ldquo;cognitive architecture&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; a model of how the structure of the mind and its components work together to achieve human cognition.</description>

If you read nothing else in the post, read the end.
&amp;ldquo;A New Kind of Science&amp;rdquo; is a 13-year-old book preceded, and regrettably often prejudged, by its reputation. Many of the criticisms that have come to define the work are valid, so let&#39;s get that part out in the open. The book can be read in its entirety here; it is enormous, both physically (~1,200 pages) and in scope, which has led to a limited and specialized readership lodging many legitimate, though mostly technical, complaints.</description>

Today I read Papa Francesca&#39;s second encyclical, entitled &amp;ldquo;Laudato Si &amp;ndash; On Care For Our Common Home&amp;quot;.

      <description>The singular exception is provided by the human ability to remember past happenings. When one thinks today about what one did yesterday, time’s arrow is bent into a loop. The rememberer has mentally traveled back into her past and thus violated the law of the irreversibility of the flow of time. She has not accomplished the feat in physical reality, of course, but rather in the reality of the mind, which, as everyone knows, is at least as important for human beings as is the physical reality.</description>

The purpose of this post is to give some intuition for Euler&#39;s identity (&amp;ldquo;the most beautiful theorem in mathematics&amp;rdquo;) to those who haven&#39;t seen it before or to those for whom it is meaningless because they lack the math background.
This was never introduced to me in any class, and unless you majored in math or physics the same is probably true for you.</description>

      <description>In my high school psychology class I was told that human memory capacity was unlimited &amp;hellip;and it has bothered me ever since. How, I mean? Aside from the physical limitations on information storage, how could a system that remembers everything forever be evolutionarily advantageous?
This is a question I hope to explore in a deeper way sometime soon; for now, I want to talk to you about a few &amp;ldquo;peculiarities of human memory&amp;rdquo; that begin to shed some light on the situation (Bjork &amp;amp; Bjork, 1992).</description>

      <description>Modern data analysis has gotten very complicated! Let&#39;s forget all that for a moment. I wanted to take this opportunity to examine several useful statistical techniques and measures of association that involve nothing more than a 2x2 contingency table. A 2x2 contingency table (also called a cross tabulation or cross tab) is a simple grid that displays the frequency distribution given two variables&amp;ndash;one variable for the columnsand one variable for the rows.</description>

      <description>When Gauss was 19, he discovered that of the infinite number of polygons that have a prime number of sides, a mere five of them can be constructed with a ruler and compass (i.e., using only straight lines and circles). These prime-sided polygons can have 3, 5, 17, 257, or 65537 sides, but only these five are possible (probably).

Indeed, the only shapes you can draw with an odd number of equal-length sides are the multiples of these 5 primes: 3, 5, 15, 17, 51, 85,&amp;hellip;, 4294967295</description>

      <description>In A Mathematician&#39;s Lament, Paul Lockhart roundly decries the way our school system sucks the soul out of mathematics; what was forced down most of our throats was an insipid husk of repetitive calculation, plug-in formulae, and rigid formality, all of which we were called upon biweekly to regurgitate. Most painful for him to see is the way geometry is taught:
If you haven&#39;t read the Lament yet, definitely stop what you&#39;re doing and take the next 30 minutes to do so; if you have any interest at all in mathematics or education, it will be one of the best-spent half-hours of your life.</description>

      <description>I waste a lot of time preparing and drinking coffee. My coffee ritual (cleaning the press, filling it anew, boiling water, brewing, plunging the grounds, pouring) takes around 3 minutes of active attention, and I perform this holy rite 2-3 times each day. Reckoning roughly, at this rate I spend ~48 hours &amp;ndash;two full days out of each year&amp;ndash; making coffee, and this figure likely an underestimate&amp;hellip;
Worse still, I don&#39;t even notice the caffeine anymore!</description>

      <description>This first in a series of posts about the biology of learning and memory has been written plainly, with much care taken to ensure its general-audience accessibility.
TL;DR: neurons communicate with other neurons by releasing chemicals called neurotransmitters onto them; these chemicals bind to receptors on the neighboring neurons. When a neuron repeatedly &amp;ldquo;fires&amp;rdquo; on another neuron, this triggers the latter to produce additional receptors and can even stimulate physical growth toward the former; thus, the latter becomes especially sensitive to the former and more likely to fire when the former does.</description>

It&#39;s been six years since I competed, but every February, about three weeks in, some sort of high school atavism reminds my unconscious that Academic Decathlon just had its Texas State meet and urges me online to acadecscores (which may be down; the servers are spotty this time of year&amp;hellip;) to review the damage.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve been recently acquainted with a statistical technique of amazing utility and versatility that has its roots in matrix decomposition, a basic&amp;mdash;though profound&amp;mdash;concept in linear algebra.
For the purposes of this discussion, we&#39;re going to consider it a very elegant way of taking a large, confusing dataset with many variables and transforming it so that you can find patterns based on the correlations among the variables, thus allowing you to describe your data with fewer of them.</description>

Anyway, the day&#39;s topic was aging and dementia and they were reporting in their pop-sciencey way on findings from the &amp;ldquo;Nun Study&amp;quot;&amp;mdash;a longitudinal study funded by the National Institute of Aging to examine the onset of Alzheimer&#39;s disease in a population of some 700 nuns who have been participating in the study since 1986 (the youngest at the time was 75).</description>

But disqualification on both ends notwithstanding let&#39;s forge ahead and see what comes of it. First, you have probably noticed that computers are everywhere: to use a colorful, if somewhat perplexing, expression, you can&#39;t swing a cat without hitting one these days, and when I&#39;m not staring straight into one of my own, I&#39;m probably still using one in some way or other:</description>

      <description>Earlier this month I presciently looked up and checked out the only non-reserve copy of a book that was required for one of my upcoming courses. Then, a few days ago, I got the dreaded but by now familiar recalled email, prompted by someone else&#39;s request (doubtlessly someone else in my class who is just now getting around to reading the syllabus). I&#39;ve got to return the book by the 28th, and I&#39;m miffed about it.</description>

We got into Auckland in the early afternoon on NYE. Everything is beautiful: all of the plants are unique-looking and typical road-side terrain&amp;mdash;berms and such&amp;mdash;are often breathtaking. Driving on the left-hand side is like learning to drive all over again&amp;mdash;not difficult really, but you feel that familiar tenseness and vigilance, with the car tending far too close to the curb. The weather is perfect, with both cool breezes and toasty sunshine.</description>

      <description>I enjoy riding buses and trains; I like their consistency&amp;mdash;the same times, the same drivers&amp;mdash;but I also like their novelty&amp;mdash;the strange new people you are exposed to from the safety of your seat. I like riding my bike, too, but only sometimes, and not too far. There again, the bus provides: a pull-down bike-rack hangs off of the front of each one and there is usually a vacant slot.
The car-as-status-symbol is lower-middle class at best; the upper crust has developed more effective ways of signifying social clout.</description>

That&#39;s fine for around-the-house applications, but when your academic adviser (who is retiring this year) asks, &amp;ldquo;Where&#39;s your computer!&amp;rdquo; every time you have a meeting with her, you know it&#39;s about time to get a new, backpack-friendly means of computing.</description>

If you use the &amp;ldquo;highlighter&amp;rdquo; function in a .pdf reader, you might find this service helpful (sumnotes.net); with a click, it copies all of the text you&#39;ve highlighted and combines it into a single file.

      <description>Hello and welcome! My name is Nathaniel Woodward (né Raley)
I am a Lecturer in the Department of Statistics and Data Sciences at UT Austin, where I earned both PhD (2018) and MS (2016) and where I previously worked as a researcher and statistical consultant.
I am interested in modern statistical approaches to causal inference, especially as they apply to evaluations of human learning and memory. In my research, I have used institutional data to investigate teaching effectiveness, curriculum redesign, pathways through college, and other questions important to university stakeholders.</description>
