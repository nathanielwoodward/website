<h1>Hello and welcome!</h1>

<p>My name is Nathaniel Woodward (<em>né</em> Raley)</p>
<p>I am a data science professional and former faculty member in <a href="https://stat.utexas.edu/">Statistics and Data Sciences</a> at UT Austin, where I earned both PhD (2018) and MS (2016) while working as a researcher and statistical consultant.</p>
<p>I am interested in modern statistical approaches to causal inference, especially as they apply to evaluations of human behavior. In my research, I have used institutional data to investigate teaching effectiveness, curriculum redesign, pathways through college, and other questions important to university stakeholders.</p>
<p>I have experience modeling the causal effect of large-scale interventions, including a nationwide randomized effectiveness trial. I have also conducted laboratory studies with human subjects to test interventions designed to improve long-term retention and transfer of learning to new contexts.</p>
<p>I am also interested in human–computer interaction and have experience applying psychometric techniques to adaptively model latent traits (such as ability and mastery) based on people’s interactions with technology (e.g., click-stream and other log data, biometric measurements) and using such models to inform predictions and to optimize training regimens.</p>
